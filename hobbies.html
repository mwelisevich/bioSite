                    <h3>Crafts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Taylor received her bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design. 
                        In addition to numerous graphic design classes, she was 
                        required to take plenty of courses in various physical arts, 
                        such as painting, ceramics, drawing, hand lettering, and 
                        sculpture. While she may not heavily rely on the skills in 
                        her graphic design work, she loves doing these types of arts 
                        as a hobby. She engaged in several home beautification 
                        projects in the house she just recently sold. She made door 
                        hangers and other forms of crafts to decorate her home with. 
                        While she may not have the home in Omaha anymore, most of her 
                        crafts came with her to spruce up her residence in the United 
                        Kingdom.

                        From an early age, Taylor has always loved the great outdoors. 
                        She spent her childhood camping across the country with her 
                        parents and grandparents. Now she spends weekends from the 
                        spring through the fall camping with her husband and dogs. 
                        They have camped all over the United States, and after their 
                        move to Europe they purchased a teardrop camper to camp all 
                        over Europe. Taylor has already identified several choice 
                        camping locations in England, Scotland, and Wales that her 
                        family will be camping in soon. After the restrictions of 
                        COVID-19 begin to scale back, all of Europe will be ripe 
                        for camping.

                    <h3>Travel</h3>
                    <p>
                        Camping and travel can go hand-in-hand. Even still, Taylor 
                        has a love of travel that exceeds merely camping. When she 
                        was 16 she traveled to Costa Rica and loved the experience. 
                        She has been to Canada a few times. When she moved to 
                        California, she took the opportunity to travel the West Coast 
                        as much as she could, seeing numerous parks and historic sites. 
                        he world of travel really opened up to her over the past six 
                        months, when she and her family moved to England. They have 
                        already visited London multiple times and see various historic 
                        sites in the United Kingdom. Again, after the restrictions of 
                        COVID-19 ease, her family will travel all over Europe.
