                Taylor was born in 1995 and grew up in St. Paul Minnesota. 
                She played multiple sports in high school, lettering in Volleyball and Softball. 
                When she was 14, she met Michael Welisevich, who she would go on to marry in the summer of 2017. 
                She was the yearbook editor her senior year, a job she loved and took very seriously. 
                She attended college at Southwest Minnesota State University. 
                The joy she had in yearbook lead her to get her degree in graphic design. 
                Throughout college, Taylor was a Resident Assistant, and was quickly promoted to Senior Resident Assistant. 
                Taylor loved helping new college students find their way through their first few years away from home. 
                In her spare time, Taylor worked as a barista at Starbucks, and later Caribou Coffee. 
                After graduation she moved with her husband to California for a year and then Nebraska for two years. 
                In spring of 2021 they moved to Bury St. Edmunds, England where they currently reside with their two dogs.
	            Since her childhood Taylor has always had a love for dogs. Heartbreakingly, 
                Taylor had to say goodbye to her childhood dog too soon. 
                The moment she and her husband moved to Seaside, California, they rescued a 
                Border Collie/Long-Haired German Sheppard mix. Her name was Zena and it was love at 
                first sight. Eventually, once Taylor and her husband bought a house in Nebraska, 
                they decided it was time for another dog and found a Pembroke Welsh Corigi puppy. 
                They were instantly in love with him and named him Elwood. Elwood and Zena have been 
                enjoying England almost as much as Taylor and Michael have.
