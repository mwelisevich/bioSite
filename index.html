            Growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota, Taylor has experienced a rich 
            urban environment while also the pleasures of midwestern life. 
            She and her husband spent time living on the West Coast before 
            returning to the Midwest where they lived in Omaha, Nebraska for 
            two years before embarking on the biggest adventure of their 
            lives when they moved to England, UK in April. Taylor and her 
            husband have visited London a few times and thoroughly enjoyed 
            all their trips. Taylor Absolutely loves all things Disney. When 
            she and her husband moved to California, she knew she could 
            fulfill her lifelong dream of visiting Disneyland. Within two years, 
            she would check off another goal and visit Disneyworld. 
            Next on the list is Disneyland Paris.

            Moving to Europe has been an exciting change, but 
            Taylor and her family did say goodbye to their home 
            in Nebraska, selling their first home only a year 
            after they first purchased it. One cannot discuss 
            Taylor without mentioning her two dogs. Taylor 
            has a Border Collie/German Sheppard named Zena 
            that she and her husband rescued when they lived 
            in Seaside, California. Her other dog is a rascal 
            named Elwood who is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi they 
            picked up during their time in Nebraska. The dogs 
            are fitting in perfectly in England, having met 
            countless friends at the dog parks in the area.
